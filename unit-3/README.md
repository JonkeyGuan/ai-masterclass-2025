## Outline

This unit focuses on introducing TrustyAI's evaluation and safeguarding with Openshift AI. 

The practical exercises can be accessed [here](https://github.com/trustyai-explainability/trustyai-llm-demo/tree/main). Note that there are two branches: `main` (evaluation and safeguarding) and `lemonade-stand` (safeguarding only). 

## Steps

- Ensure you have Openshift CLI installed -- check out these [instructions](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_build_of_microshift/4.12/html/cli_tools/microshift-oc-cli-install#cli-installing-cli-brew_cli-oc-installing)

On a Mac, the simplest way to install the CLI is via Homebrew:

```shell
brew install openshift-cli
```

- Git clone the aforementioned repository e.g.:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/trustyai-explainability/trustyai-llm-demo.git 
```

- Change into the directory and follow the steps in the demos
